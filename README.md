# Multiclass_Alaphanumerics_classification_SVM

I trained an SVM to classify 34 Alpha Numeric classes. The images were extracted from license plates of vehicles this model along with a mobilenet-SSD and a segmentation algorithm was used to build an end-to-end ALPR (automatic license plate recognition) system for Motorbikes and cars which outperformed the previously available ones for Indian traffic.

The training dataset consists of 68,000 Images(2000 of each class). The images were first normalized using min-max scaling before training the SVM. The final trained SVM gives a test accuracy of 98%.
